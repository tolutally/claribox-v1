🚀 MVP Feature List (Ranked by Impact)
1️⃣ Gmail Sidebar: “Today’s Email Clarity Panel”

Your core product. Always visible on the right side of Gmail.

Sections inside the sidebar:

Top Summary Bar:
- Important emails today (count)
- Emails waiting for your response (count)
- Noise filtered (count)
Important Today (3–5 items)
- Emails you must see

Follow-Ups Needed
- Emails where you owe a reply
- Emails where someone owes you a reply (optional)
- Automatic detection via sent messages
Noise Summary

- One-click “Archive All Noise”

Why this is MVP-critical:
This is your at-a-glance clarity experience — your flagship feature.

2️⃣ Email Processing Engine (Backend)
Lightweight but powerful rules + AI.

Core responsibilities:

Identify important vs non-important emails

Detect follow-ups

Recognize “noise” (ads, promos, bulk)

Categorize each email into:

Important

Requires Response

Noise

FYI

Classification method:

Rules first (fast & reliable)

AI LLM for nuance (urgency, request detection)

Store decisions in DB

3️⃣ Morning Digest (Delivered via Email + Sidebar)

A simple, beautiful daily summary at 7–9 AM.

Content:

5 most important emails

Follow-up list

Missed important emails from yesterday

Noise cleared

Quick actions: open, archive, reply

Why:

Creates daily habit → retention machine → delightful.

4️⃣ Follow-Up Detection Engine

This is the “painkiller” engine.

Detect:

Emails you sent that haven’t been replied to

Emails where someone asked for something

Threads where you promised something

Deadlines mentioned in emails

“Can you…?”, “Let me know…”, “Please review…”

Output:

A clean follow-up checklist in the sidebar + digest.

5️⃣ Noise Filtering (Safe Version)

Not aggressive. Not auto-deleting. Just “smart grouping.”

Features:

Group newsletters & promotions

Group CC-only threads

Group automated notifications

“Archive All Noise” (one click)

Why:

People hate email tools that over-filter.
This gives clarity without risk.

6️⃣ Gmail Chrome Extension (Manifest v3)

Injects the UI into Gmail.

Features:

Right-side panel

Collapse/expand

Works on inbox + thread view

Opens Gmail threads in new tab or same tab

OAuth permission handshake

This is the entire delivery surface for MVP.

7️⃣ OAuth Sign-In with Google (Read-Only Gmail Access)

No sending email, no writing.

Scopes:

Read-only Gmail access

Basic user profile

Why:

Users trust read-only

Makes onboarding frictionless

Avoids privacy fear

8️⃣ Backend API (Email Insights API)

Endpoints for the sidebar & digest.

Core endpoints:

/summary/today

/emails/important

/emails/followups

/emails/noise

/digest/today

/user/preferences

Light caching (Redis or memory)
9️⃣ User Preferences (Lightweight)

Small settings menu inside sidebar.

Options:

Digest time

Noise definition

Follow-up age threshold (e.g., 2 days)

Collapse panel by default (yes/no)

🔟 Event Triggers & Notification Layer (MVP-lite)

Not a full notification system.

Triggers:

Send Daily Digest

Refresh when Gmail tab opens

Manual “Refresh Insights” button in sidebar

✨ Optional (High Impact, Low Cost) MVP Extras

Choose if time permits:

⭐ 1. “Important Sender Memory”

Mark senders as always-important (boss, clients, family).

⭐ 2. Smart CC Detector

If you’re in CC only → mark as FYI automatically.

⭐ 3. Batch Actions

Mark all noise as read

Archive all promos

Pin important emails

⭐ 4. One-click “Focus Mode”

Show ONLY:

important

follow-up
for distraction-free mode.

❌ MVP Features to Avoid (until v2)

These slow you down and provide little incremental value early:

AI-generated email replies

Email sending

Auto-archiving rules

Smart scheduling

AI-driven “rewrite this email”

Multiple accounts support

Outlook integrations

Team shared inbox

Meeting notetaker integration

CRM integrations
These can come later — not MVP.
